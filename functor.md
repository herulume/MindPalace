# Functor

- Morphism between categories ([[category]])
- Maps [[object]]s to objects and [[morphism]]s to morphisms
- A functor $F : C \to B$ between categories $C$ and $D$ maps objects and morphisms as $F(f : A \to B) = F(f) : F(A) \to F(B)$

## Functor laws
1. $F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ F(f)$
2. $F(1_A) = 1_{(F A)}$

This laws are called **functoriality**.
