- A relationship between [[file:20200914154910-functor.org][functors]]
- Relates [[file:20200824184713-category.org][categories]] in a "weak" way (equivalence)

* Notation

$F \dashv G$

- $F$ is the left adjoint of $G$
- $G$ is the right adjoint of $F$
* Definition via Hom-set adjunction

- Let $F : D \to C$ and $G:C \to D$ be [[file:20200914154910-functor.org][functors]]

- $\forall X \in Ob(C)$ $\forall Y \in Ob(D)$ there's a [[file:20200927231404-bijection.org][bijection]] between the respective morphisms sets

$hom_C(FY, X) \cong hom_D(Y, GX)$

such that this bijections are natural in $X$ and $Y$.

** Meaning of natural

Natural here means that there are [[file:20200927173107-natural_isomorphism.org][natural isomorphisms]] between:

$C(F-,X) : D \to Set$
$D(-, GX) : D \to Set$
For a fixed $X \in C$

And between

$C(FY, -) : C \to Set$
$D(Y, G-) : C \to Set$
For a fixed $Y \in D$
* Definition via unit and counit

- Let $F : D \to C$ and $G:C \to D$ be [[file:20200914154910-functor.org][functors]]
- Let $\epsilon : FG \to 1_C$ (counit) and $\eta : 1_D \to FG$ (unit) be [[file:20200927165017-natural_transformation.org][natural transformations]]

such that

$1_F = \epsilon F \circ F\eta$
$1_G = G\epsilon \circ \eta G$

- For each $X \in G$ and $Y \in D$

$1_{FY} = \epsilon FY \circ F(\eta Y)$
$1_{GX} = G(\epsilon X) \circ \eta GX$
