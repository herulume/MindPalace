* Chapter 1 - Orders and Galois connections
** 1.1 - More than the sum of their parts
   - Structures are compositional but the results of observing them may not be
   - Observation is "lossy": information extraction requires loss of some details
   - Some details can be relevant

   - CT is concerned with structures and structure preserving maps
   - Map $f : X \to Y$ allows us to extract certain features of C by looking at Y
   - Determining what aspects we want to preserve amounts to deciding in what category we should work on

   - Generative effects :: "surprises" when we observe operations not preserved by the observation
*** 1.1.1 - A first look at generative effects
    - 3 points :: o; *; .
    - System :: way to connect the points
      - Connections are symmetric and transitive
    - Observation ::  $\Phi$ = . is connect to *
    - Operation :: Join aka  $A \lor B$
      - Transitive closure of the union of the elements

      - Combining raw data and then extracting information yields different results than extracting information from both sources separately
