- $(M, \bullet, u)$
- Set $M$ equipped with a binary operation $\bullet : M \times M \to M$ and a unit element $u$
- $\forall x,y,z \in M$ then $x \bullet (y \bullet z) = (x \bullet y) \bullet z$ and $u \bullet x = x = x \bullet u$

- Sometimes called a [[file:20200916145644-semi_group.org][semi-group]] with a unit

* Monoid as a category

Given a monoid $(M, \bullet, u)$

- Objects :: One single object (doesn't matter what this object is)
- Morphisms :: $\forall m \in M$
- Composition :: $\bullet$
- Identity morphism :: $u$

- A [[file:20200914154910-functor.org][functor]] between two [[file:20200916144615-monoid.org][monoids]] as a [[file:20200824184713-category.org][category]] is a monoid [[file:20200908180443-homomorphism.org][homomorphism]]
