- Morphism between [[file:20200824184713-category.org][categories]]
- Maps objects to objects and morphisms to morphisms
- A functor $F : C \to B$ between categories $C$ and $D$ maps objects and morphisms as $F(f : A \to B) = F(f) : F(A) \to F(B)$

* Functor laws
1. $F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ F(f)$
2. $F(1_A) = 1_F_(_A_)$

This laws are called /functoriality%/.
