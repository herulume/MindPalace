# My notes on Quantum Computing For Computer Scientists

This will be a slow read.

## Introduction

### From Real Numbers to Complex Numbers

- Quantum mechanics uses complex numbers in a fundamental way
- `i = √−1` was the "imaginary" solution to the polynomial equation "x² = −1"

## From Single States to Superpositions of States

- Every object exists in a unique place and in a well-defined state
- Even when we are not looking at it
- This is only true for large objects

- A microscopic object can "be in more than one place at a time"
- We say that an object is in a "superposition"
- In some sense, it is simultaneously in more than one location at the same time
- Other familiar physical properties are also hazy

- We do not see superposition of states
- Every time we look, measure, a superposition of states, it "collapses" to a single well-defined state

## From Locality to Non-locality

- Objects are directly affected only by nearby objects or forces
- To determine why a phenomenon occurs at a certain place, one must examine all the phenomena and forces near that place
- This is called "locality"
- Quantum mechanics laws predict certain effects that work in a nonlocal manner
- Two particles can be connected, "entangled", such that an action performed on one of them can have an immediate effect on the other particle light-years away

## From Deterministic Laws to Probabilistic Laws

- To which specific state will a superposition of states collapse when it is measured?
- The laws of quantum mechanics state that we can only know the probability of the outcome

## From Certainty to Uncertainty

- There are inherent limitations to the amount of knowledge that one can ascertain about a physical system
