## The opposite of uncritical thinking

**Uncritical thinking** is automatically believing what you read or are told without pausing to ask whether it is accurate, true, or reasonable. 

Critical thinking is about learning to recognize ours, and other's, limitations. Pausing, thinking again, and ask the right questions. 

**Critical thinking** is setting out actively to understand what is really going on by using reasoning, evaluating evidence, and thinking carefully about the process of thinking itself.

Critical thinking is only possible to a degree. 

## Skepticism and objectivity 

**Skepticism** is not automatically accepting something you hear, read, or see as true. Refusing to take something at face value. 

**Objectivity** is trying to understand something from a more neutral perspective, rather than relying on a single opinion or the first piece of information that comes to hand. 

Objectivity and skepticism are related concepts. Both involve a commitment to finding out what is  going on. They are only possible to a degree.

## Smart study: Becoming a better skeptic 

Four questions to ask whenever we need to think twice.

1. Why should I trust this?
2. Why does the person making this claim believe it - or want me to believe it?
3. What else has been said, written, or reported about this?
4. Do I know enough to answer all the above questions confidently?

##  The battle against bias

**Bias** is looking at things in a one-sided way.

**Conscious bias** is when someone's views are distorted deliberately.

**Unconscious bias** is when someone's views are distorted by factors that they are not aware of.

Full absence of bias is impossible. 

## Fast and slow thinking

- Slow down: critical thinking cannot happen in a rush.
- WYSIATI: *What You See Is All There Is*, an acronym used by Daniel Kahneman to describe the human tendency to pay attention only to what is immediately obvious. 

**Survivorship bias** is the tendency only to think about successful examples, failing to see the bigger picture.
**Confirmation bias** is the tendency to use new information to confirm existing beliefs.
**Dogmatism** is the claim that certain principles or ideas are both absolutely true.
**Reasoning** is thinking about things in a sensible or logical way, and then presenting this thinking so as to permit meaningful debate, disagreement, and collaboration.

## What is critical thinking for?

Critical thinking helps us to search for the best account we can find the way things actually are.
